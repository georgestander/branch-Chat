2026-01-09 — UI layout/navigation: branch highlight metadata + parent alignment scroll, sidebar/branch navigate keeps parent open, min widths 520/360/280, removed max-width constraints. PRD: PRD-UI-001/002/003/004/005/007. Files: src/app/shared/markdown.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchableMessage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx.
2026-01-09 — Added npm scripts for required feedback loops (typecheck/test/lint) to enable mandated runs. Files: package.json.
2026-01-09 — Brutalist UI pass: black/white tokens + blue accent, darker borders, message bubbles + code blocks hardened, composer bar black/white; streaming anchor keeps start visible; web results filtered to external links. PRD: PRD-UI-006/008/009/010/011. Files: src/app/styles.css, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ToolInvocationSummary.tsx.
2026-01-09 — Parent pane auto-opens when branch has a parent to preserve origin context. PRD: PRD-UI-004/005. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx.
2026-01-09 — Created scoping-interviewer skill + packaged .skill. PRD: N/A. Decisions: workflow-based interview; scope.state.json single source; no extra resources. Files: /Users/georgestander/.codex/skills/scoping-interviewer/SKILL.md, /Users/georgestander/.codex/skills/scoping-interviewer.skill, progress.txt. Notes: packaging used local venv for pyyaml.
2026-01-09 — Composer constrained to centered max width again (fixed full-width regression). PRD: PRD-UI-001/011. Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.

2026-01-09 — Composer footer set to black band to remove white gutter; forced white input + caret + help text. PRD: PRD-UI-001/011. Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx.
2026-01-09 — Split view sizing fix: active (child) stays largest, resize clamps keep active readable, composer aligns to column width. PRD: PRD-UI-001/002. Decisions: cap parent ratio at 45%%; clamp ratio on container resize; allow parent min to soften when constrained. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx. Notes: none.
- Task: Composer only in active branch (PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation/composer placement).
- Decisions: remove inactive footer + reduce bottom padding to avoid fake composer space; keep active composer docked in active column for clear focus.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx
- Notes: none
- Task: Fix active-branch padding regression (PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation).
- Decisions: move scroll padding calc into BranchColumn scope to avoid SSR ReferenceError.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx
- Notes: none
- Task: Keep active branch readable in split view (PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation).
- Decisions: allow columns to shrink via min-w-0 and remove parent shrink lock to prevent overflow clipping.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx
- Notes: none
2026-01-13 — Fix dev server port collision by pinning Vite to 5174 with strictPort. PRD: N/A. Decisions: avoid 5173 clash with croBuilder; force failure if occupied. Files: vite.config.mts.
2026-01-13 — UI redesign: new warm editorial theme, app-shell background, panel surfaces, refreshed sidebar/cards/messages, and floating centered composer in active branch. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation/composer placement; UX & A11y. Decisions: preserve all behaviors, increase scroll bottom padding for floating composer, keep popovers readable via light surfaces. Files: src/app/styles.css, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationSidebar.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/StreamingBubble.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ToolInvocationSummary.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchableMessage.tsx. Notes: Manual check—happy: sidebar toggle, branch switch, resize, send message, tools menu, model menu; failure: tool upload error display, search failure banner.
2026-01-13 — Empty state UX: clickable recent chats + centered composer-style start form (still only creates chat). PRD: Core Experience > Conversation management; UX & A11y. Decisions: preserve createConversation flow; input is decorative until chat opens. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Theme shift to black/white base with blue primary + orange/red accent per request. PRD: UX & A11y. Decisions: monochrome surfaces with limited accent saturation. Files: src/app/styles.css.
2026-01-13 — Prevent active branch/composer squish: lower parent ratio, raise active min width, enable horizontal scroll when constrained, and keep floating composer full width on narrow columns. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation; UX & A11y. Decisions: preserve split behavior while keeping active column dominant. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Enforce active column dominance: lower parent ratio, increase active min width, and prevent parent flex shrink. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation. Decisions: keep horizontal scroll when constrained; guarantee active width. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Auto-collapse parent column when space is too tight to keep active branch/composer fully visible; widen floating composer container on narrow columns. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation. Decisions: preserve split UX, but force visibility at small widths. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Split view fix: remove forced collapse/horizontal scroll, allow parent to shrink, and cap active min width to viewport so active content/composer stays visible while keeping resizer. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation. Decisions: active column never overflows viewport; parent yields space when constrained. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Split sizing overhaul: compute usable width (minus resizer), set explicit parent/active widths to keep active within viewport, and restore centered composer max width. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation/composer placement. Decisions: parent width derived from clamped ratio; active never overflows viewport. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Nudge active branch minimum width to 780px to stay slightly wider than composer. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation. Decisions: keep composer max width 720px. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Tighten active/composer sizing: composer max width 680px + reduced horizontal padding; active min width 720px to stay slightly wider. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation/composer placement. Decisions: reduce perceived empty space while keeping desktop-friendly centered composer. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Reduce active min width to 680px (slightly above 640px composer), allow more parent width via max ratio 0.48, and nudge default ratio to 0.34. PRD: Core Experience > Branch navigation/composer placement. Decisions: keep active dominant by default but allow tighter fit when resizing. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Empty-state composer now boots new chat with first message + auto-send. PRD: Core Experience > Conversation management; UX & A11y. Decisions: stash draft in sessionStorage keyed by conversationId; consume once on layout mount and auto-send via composer for streaming/retry. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx. Notes: Manual check—happy: home draft sends + streams on new chat; failure: send error leaves draft for retry.
2026-01-13 — Fix home auto-send bootstrap race so send triggers after value populates. PRD: Core Experience > Conversation management; UX & A11y. Decisions: wait until composer value is non-empty before comparing pending bootstrap message. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx. Notes: Browser test via Playwright against 192.168.50.134:5174 shows auto-send + streaming.
2026-01-13 — Composer model menu emojis for fast/reasoning tiers, right-aligned and small to avoid layout impact. PRD: UX & A11y; Core Experience > Conversation management. Decisions: fixed-width emoji badge, no check icon, rely on selected state styling. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx.
2026-01-13 — Fix Study & Learn agent by wiring OpenAI client into Agents SDK (uses env binding instead of process.env). PRD: Core Experience > Chat engine. Decisions: setDefaultOpenAIClient with ctx.getOpenAIClient per run to avoid missing API key in Workers. Files: src/app/shared/openai/studyAndLearnAgent.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts. Notes: none.
- Task: Set GPT-5 response verbosity to low (PRD: model output verbosity).
- Decisions: Applied only to gpt-5* models via Responses options to avoid unsupported models; left other response calls unchanged.
- Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts.
- Notes: worker-configuration.d.ts has unrelated local modifications; left untouched.
2026-02-05 — Saved public beta launch plan doc + created planning branch. Ref: N/A (launch roadmap). Decisions: branch name `codex/public-beta-launch-plan`; plan stored in Docs for handoff. Files: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt. Notes: existing unrelated local change remains in worker-configuration.d.ts.
2026-02-05 — Phase1 slice A: decoupled focus collapse and persisted composer tools (fixes sidebar/parent collapse coupling + web-search reset on branch switch). Ref: Launch plan Phase1. Decisions: `focus=child` now auto-collapses parent only; initial collapse applied once per mount; selected tools persisted in sessionStorage per conversation. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, progress.txt. Notes: existing unrelated worker-configuration.d.ts left untouched.
2026-02-05 — Phase1 slice B: improved live streaming cadence + added tool/reasoning feedback events in streaming bubble. Ref: Launch plan Phase1. Decisions: reduce SSE publish threshold to 16 chars / 120ms; emit `tool_progress` and `reasoning_summary` over existing SSE channel; keep completion/error flow unchanged. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/components/conversation/StreamingBubble.tsx, progress.txt. Notes: reasoning summary best-effort from stream deltas and final response payload.

- Task: Audit conversation access patterns for auth/ownership risks (Verifier task). PRD: Docs/PRD.md (auth/ownership)
- Decisions: Highlighted lack of ownership checks; propose optional ownerId + lazy claim + directory filtering; keep legacy snapshots readable to avoid breakage.
- Files: src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/shared/conversationDirectory.server.ts, src/lib/durable-objects/ConversationDirectory.ts, src/app/shared/conversation.server.ts, src/app/shared/uploads.server.ts, src/app/shared/uploadsProxy.server.ts, src/lib/durable-objects/ConversationStore.ts, src/lib/conversation/model.ts, src/worker.tsx, src/app/context.ts
- Notes: Edge cases default conversation id, legacy records without owner, missing directory owner; guard strategy should claim-on-write.
2026-02-06 — Phase2 slice: auth identity context + per-user conversation ownership enforced server-side (including directory filtering and legacy owner claim). Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 1-2. Decisions: request identity resolves from auth headers or HttpOnly cookie fallback; default conversation id now user-scoped via resolver; snapshots without owner auto-claim to current user; directory DO now requires ownerId for list/mutate and filters per owner. Files: src/app/shared/auth.server.ts, src/app/context.ts, src/worker.tsx, src/lib/conversation/model.ts, src/lib/conversation/validation.ts, src/app/shared/conversation.server.ts, src/lib/durable-objects/ConversationDirectory.ts, src/app/shared/conversationDirectory.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/shared/uploads.server.ts, src/app/shared/uploadsProxy.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation notes—happy: new user cookie gets isolated conversation space; failure: owner mismatch throws access denied and directory excludes foreign conversation ids.

2026-02-06 scout pass quota demo (PRD: quotas/usage gating). Decisions: new AccountDO per user; reserve/commit/release per sendMessage stream; 10-pass default stored in DO with reservations. Files changed: progress.txt. Notes: design only, no code changes yet.
2026-02-06 — Phase2 slice: demo quota lane with reserve/commit/release semantics around sendMessage. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 3 & 6 (partial). Decisions: add per-user AccountDO (10 total passes), reserve before generation, commit only on successful generation finalization, release on failures; return quota metadata from sendMessage for UI follow-up. Files: src/lib/durable-objects/Account.ts, src/app/shared/account.server.ts, src/app/context.ts, src/worker.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, wrangler.jsonc, types/env.d.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation notes—happy: successful stream decrements remaining passes after commit; failure: reserve denial blocks generation and stream/finalization errors release reservations.
2026-02-06 — Verifier audit: OpenRouter routing risks (streaming, tools, settings) + guardrails/tests checklist. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md (OpenRouter routing). Decisions: enumerate incompatibilities (Responses stream events, web-search/tooling assumptions, model naming/effort heuristics); propose provider-capability registry and UI gating; list manual checks. Files: progress.txt. Notes: no code changes.
2026-02-06 — Phase2 slice: OpenRouter model selector + provider routing for sendMessage. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 5 (partial) and Phase3 start-controls model selection. Decisions: model selector now includes server-fetched OpenRouter catalog (cached + auth-aware disable/fallback); models stored with `openrouter:` prefix for deterministic provider routing; sendMessage routes prefixed models through OpenRouter Responses client and keeps OpenAI defaults for non-prefixed models; web-search/reasoning gated by capability helpers to avoid invalid OpenRouter tool/reasoning usage. Files: src/app/shared/openrouterModels.server.ts, src/lib/openrouter/models.ts, src/lib/openai/models.ts, src/lib/openai/client.ts, src/worker.tsx, src/app/context.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, types/env.d.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation—happy: OpenRouter models appear + selectable when OPENROUTER_API_KEY set and stream works; failure: missing/invalid OpenRouter key hides list or returns actionable send error.
2026-02-07 — Phase2 slice: encrypted BYOK credential primitives in account DO + server helpers. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 3-4. Decisions: add normalized optional `byok` record on AccountDO (provider/ciphertext/iv/version/createdAt/updatedAt) with GET/POST/DELETE `/byok`; derive AES-GCM key from `BYOK_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` via Web Crypto digest; keep status/save/delete metadata-only and resolve path plaintext-only with no plaintext logs/errors. Files: src/lib/durable-objects/Account.ts, src/app/shared/account.server.ts, src/app/shared/byokCrypto.server.ts, types/env.d.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation notes—happy: set/get/delete byok returns expected metadata and status.connected toggles; failure: owner mismatch returns 403 and decrypt/version mismatch throws generic resolve error.
2026-02-07 — Phase2 slice: sendMessage demo/BYOK lane resolution with provider-aware BYOK client routing. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 3-4 & 6 (BYOK send path). Decisions: add optional input `lane`; infer provider from model prefix (`openrouter:` vs default OpenAI); BYOK lane now requires resolved credential `{provider, apiKey}` and errors on missing/mismatch with actionable messages; demo lane keeps reserve/commit/release unchanged while BYOK skips quota ops; BYOK OpenRouter client preserves referer/title headers via env/request origin. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/shared/account.server.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; no blockers.
2026-02-07 — Wave3 BYOK composer UX: lane selector + connect/disconnect key flow + quota handoff in composer. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 3/4/6. Decisions: added server actions for account snapshot/BYOK save-delete using existing account helpers; composer fetches account state on mount+conversation change, gates BYOK lane on connection, passes lane into sendMessage, and opens BYOK panel with actionable copy on demo-cap failure; quota indicator now reflects lane + remaining demo passes from account state/send responses. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual happy path—connect key, switch to BYOK lane, send succeeds, disconnect falls back to demo; failure path—demo cap error prompts BYOK connect panel.
2026-02-07 — P2-T2: OpenRouter demo routing now retries once from configured primary model to configured backup model on stream init failure. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 5 + Success Criteria 12. Decisions: added env-configurable `OPENROUTER_DEMO_PRIMARY_MODEL`/`OPENROUTER_DEMO_BACKUP_MODEL` reads in send path (safe-cast from env), route only demo+OpenRouter lane through curated primary and fallback once if distinct; keep quota and BYOK behavior unchanged. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation pending forced primary failure scenario.
2026-02-07 — P2-T1: auth_required middleware gate for chat interactions. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 1 + Success Criteria 5/7. Decisions: added `AUTH_REQUIRED` truthy parser and `resolveRequestAuth(..., { authRequired })` null-return path; worker now returns `401` when auth required and identity missing while keeping `/events` and `/_uploads` auth-optional for operational continuity. Files: src/app/shared/auth.server.ts, src/worker.tsx, types/env.d.ts, Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation pending with auth flag toggled.
2026-02-07 — BYOK/OpenRouter smoke unblock: removed hard fail on BYOK stored-provider mismatch in send path; now continue using selected model provider and trace mismatch for observability. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 5/6 (manual smoke stability). Decisions: keep strict missing-key failure; only soften provider-mismatch gate to avoid blocking valid key saved under wrong provider label. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual re-test required for OpenRouter BYOK send.
2026-02-07 — Smoke follow-up fixes: (1) gpt-5-chat stream verbosity compatibility and (2) OpenRouter model picker fallback for BYOK-only environments. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 5/6 + Success Criteria 10/12. Decisions: set `text.verbosity` to `medium` for `gpt-5-chat*` (keep `low` for other gpt-5 models) to avoid 400 error; when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` missing, return curated fallback OpenRouter models instead of empty list so BYOK users can still select provider models. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/shared/openrouterModels.server.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual validation pending with BYOK OpenRouter key in `.dev.vars`.
2026-02-07 — BYOK UX persistence + config diagnostics: persist lane selection across refresh and surface missing BYOK encryption secret error clearly. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 items 4/6 (manual smoke unblock). Decisions: store composer lane in sessionStorage per conversation and hydrate on mount; only auto-force demo when account state is loaded and BYOK disconnected; propagate server BYOK save error to UI and map missing secret to actionable config message in account server helpers. Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, src/app/shared/account.server.ts, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; local env check showed `BYOK_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` missing in `.dev.vars`.
2026-02-07 — BYOK config-aware UX: disable BYOK controls when server secret missing instead of allowing dead-end key entry flow. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 usability follow-up. Decisions: expose BYOK `enabled/unavailableReason` in composer account state from server; short-circuit save/resolve when BYOK not configured; composer disables BYOK lane/connect/manage actions and shows clear disabled reason. Files: src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, src/app/shared/account.server.ts, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, progress.txt. Notes: checks passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; fixes user confusion where Connect BYOK silently fell back to demo.
2026-02-07 — Phase3 foundation: conversation settings now persist start-mode defaults (`composerDefaults`) and create/settings APIs accept preset/model/reasoning/tools inputs. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase3 items 3-4.
- Decisions: introduced backward-compatible defaults + validation migration for legacy snapshots without composerDefaults; createConversation updates settings atomically when start-mode overrides are supplied; initialMessage contract accepted with deferred trace (no server auto-send side effect).
- Files: src/lib/conversation/model.ts, src/lib/conversation/validation.ts, src/app/shared/conversation.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, progress.txt.
- Notes: next wave wires UI preset/drawer controls to these server contracts.
2026-02-07 — Phase3 start-mode UI wiring: landing presets + advanced controls now drive deterministic create payload; composer defaults (preset/tools) now persisted via conversation settings and rehydrated across reload/branch switch. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase3 start-mode items.
- Decisions: enforce deterministic preset map (`fast/reasoning/study`) at create time; `custom` preserves explicit advanced selections; move composer tool defaults from session-only storage to `updateConversationSettings` (`preset + tools`) with optimistic layout state/rollback.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: no blockers. Validation run: `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`.
2026-02-07 — Phase4 study-mode contract: refactored Study & Learn prompt and runtime guardrails to enforce Socratic one-step responses with comprehension checks + recap blocks; answer-dump outputs are normalized/blocked for homework-like prompts. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase4 items 1-2.
- Decisions: encode explicit output rubric (Next step / Comprehension check / Recap / Your turn); add normalization pass to guarantee shape even when model drifts; attach guardrail telemetry to `agent:study:success` trace for observability.
- Files: src/app/shared/openai/studyAndLearnAgent.server.ts, src/app/pages/conversation/functions.ts, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation commands still pass (`pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`).
2026-02-07 — Phase4 OSS hardening: replaced starter docs with project architecture/setup/env references; added LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY; upgraded `test`/`lint` scripts from placeholders to executable checks. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase4 items 3-4.
- Decisions: keep scripts low-risk with existing toolchain (`node --test`, `tsc`-backed lint) to satisfy real gate requirement without introducing dependency churn; document Cloudflare bindings + local env expectations explicitly for forkability.
- Files: README.md, package.json, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, Docs/architecture.md, Docs/setup.md, Docs/env-vars.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: adjusted docs URLs/examples to localhost:5174 to match Vite strictPort config.
2026-02-07 — Phase1 reliability follow-up: removed forced page refresh on stream completion by reconciling persisted branch messages client-side via message events. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Success Criteria 4.
- Decisions: add `connexus:message:persisted` event payload from composer send success; BranchColumn now merges server-persisted messages into local render state and clears optimistic entries using replacement IDs, so final assistant output appears without navigation reload.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/messageEvents.ts, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: preserves SSE streaming UX and branch highlight navigation behavior.
2026-02-07 — Phase3 conversion copy pass: empty-state landing now surfaces explicit “Start free (10 passes)” and “Sign in” CTAs with auth-aware create error copy, while preserving start-mode controls. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase3 item 2 + Success Criteria 8.
- Decisions: keep CTA behavior non-blocking (start action still uses createConversation flow); map unauthorized create failures to clear sign-in guidance instead of generic failure text.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: no backend routing changes required.
2026-02-07 — Plan sync: updated `Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md` execution status with completed P1/P3/P4 slices and implementation notes. Ref: tracking hygiene.
- Decisions: record completion at task granularity (`P1-T4`, `P3-T2/3/4`, `P4-T1/2/3/4`) to keep remaining scope explicit for future iterations.
- Files: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: no runtime behavior change.
2026-02-07 — Acceptance checks added for landing CTA + sign-in gating (PRD: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 1 + Phase3 item 2).
- Task: document AUTH_REQUIRED edge cases, landing CTA failure modes, and sign-in smoke scenarios to close the plan gap.
- Decisions: focus on server auth gating + cookie lifecycle triggers; accept manual sign-in path verification until `/sign-in` handler is confirmed.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: Need to confirm actual `/sign-in` handler and gating behavior before automating tests.
2026-02-07 — Acceptance check coverage for landing CTA + sign-in gating (PRD: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 1 + Phase3 item 2).
- Task: document AUTH_REQUIRED edge cases, landing CTA failure modes, and sign-in smoke scenarios to close the plan gap.
- Decisions: focus on server auth gating + cookie lifecycle triggers; accept manual sign-in path verification until `/sign-in` target is confirmed.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: Need to confirm actual `/sign-in` handler and gating behavior before automating tests.
2026-02-07 — Sign-in proposal (PRD: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md auth gate + onboarding).
- Task: define minimal `/sign-in` route that reuses the auth cookie helper, keeps landing CTA working, and surfaces a server-first form for identity capture.
- Decisions: keep `/sign-in` auth-optional, add a server action to sanitize user identifiers and set the cookie before redirecting, and rely on existing UI shell so we can land auth without extra state clients; reasoning: this keeps middleware gating consistent when `AUTH_REQUIRED` is true while avoiding a heavyweight auth provider until later.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: Implementation follow-up needs SignIn page + functions, worker route/middleware tweak, and helper export for cookie writes.
2026-02-07 — Sign-in proposal (PRD: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md auth gate + onboarding).
- Task: define minimal `/sign-in` route that reuses the auth cookie helper, keeps landing CTA working, and surfaces a server-first form for identity capture.
- Decisions: keep `/sign-in` auth-optional, add a server action to sanitize user identifiers and set the cookie before redirecting, and rely on existing UI shell so we can land auth without extra state clients; reasoning: this keeps middleware gating consistent when `AUTH_REQUIRED` is true while avoiding a heavyweight auth provider until later.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: Implementation follow-up needs SignIn page + functions, worker route/middleware tweak, and helper export for cookie writes.
2026-02-07 — Auth landing fix: implemented real `/sign-in` route + POST flow that writes `connexus_uid` and redirects, and made `/sign-in` auth-optional under middleware so CTA no longer 404/401 loops. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md landing/auth gap closure.
- Decisions: reuse existing auth cookie model (no new auth provider dependency) to unblock end-to-end sign-in path; disable guest-cookie persistence on `/sign-in` to avoid duplicate guest+user Set-Cookie on submit.
- Files: src/app/pages/sign-in/SignInPage.tsx, src/worker.tsx, src/app/shared/auth.server.ts, progress.txt.
- Notes: manual curl smoke verified `GET /sign-in` 200 and `POST /sign-in` 303 with user cookie set.
2026-02-07 — Landing showcase spec draft (planning-only) for world-class marketing/front-door experience. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase3 item 2 (landing conversion) + Success Criteria 8/10.
- Task: authored approval-gated frontend spec for dedicated landing flow with branching demo, hosted vs OSS CTAs, and donations surface.
- Decisions: keep scope front-end only; propose deterministic client-island demo (no backend calls), new `/landing` route first (do not repoint `/` yet), and explicit open-decision list for URLs + donation provider stack.
- Files: designs/landing-showcase-v1.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: awaiting user approval before any implementation PRs.
2026-02-07 — Landing showcase implementation (`/landing`) shipped from approved spec. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase3 item 2 + Success Criteria 8/10.
- Task: built dedicated marketing/education landing route with deterministic branching demo, hosted/OSS conversion paths, and donation CTAs.
- Decisions: keep `/` as product chat flow; add `/landing` as auth-optional route for top-of-funnel; use env-driven landing link config (`LANDING_*`) with safe defaults; instrument manual observability via `[TRACE] landing_*` console events + server `landing:render` trace.
- Files: src/worker.tsx, src/app/pages/landing/LandingPage.tsx, src/app/components/landing/{LandingShell.tsx,TopBarClient.tsx,HeroSection.tsx,BranchingDemoIsland.tsx,ValueStrip.tsx,PathCards.tsx,DonateSection.tsx,LandingFooter.tsx,LandingTrackedLink.tsx,types.ts}, types/env.d.ts, Docs/env-vars.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual smoke verified `GET /landing` 200 and rendered sections via local dev boot (`npm run dev` + curl).
2026-02-07 — Skill governance update: `claude-frontend-engineer` now enforces Claude as delegated frontend engineer + Codex as senior reviewer/orchestrator. Ref: process hardening for frontend execution quality.
- Task: rewrote skill workflow to add explicit role split, mandatory user approval gate, Codex review checklist, and fallback path when Claude CLI unavailable.
- Decisions: codified non-negotiables around no silent scope creep, no unverifiable test claims, and no final sign-off without independent Codex validation.
- Files: /Users/georgestander/.codex/skills/claude-frontend-engineer/SKILL.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: no product runtime changes.
2026-02-07 — ChatGPT-parity overhaul implementation pass (Codex fallback after Claude CLI write-gate). Ref: front-end parity plan approved in-session (workspace+landing+sign-in).
- Task: moved app routing to `/(landing)` + `/app(workspace)`, added root deep-link redirect compatibility, system theme toggle, single-pane-first branch UX with parent context sheet+compare entry, progressive composer controls, BYOK modal panel, and neutralized visual system for parity tone.
- Decisions: kept server action/data contracts stable; `/landing` now canonical redirect alias; sign-in default redirect set to `/app`; retained branch compare mode as explicit opt-in while defaulting to single-pane.
- Files: src/worker.tsx, src/app/pages/landing/LandingPage.tsx, src/app/pages/sign-in/SignInPage.tsx, src/app/Document.tsx, src/app/styles.css, src/app/components/ui/{theme.ts,ThemeToggle.tsx}, src/app/components/conversation/{ConversationLayout.tsx,ParentContextSheet.tsx,ConversationComposer.tsx,BranchColumn.tsx,BranchableMessage.tsx,ConversationEmptyLayout.tsx}, src/app/pages/conversation/{ConversationPage.tsx,ConversationSidebar.tsx}, src/app/components/landing/TopBarClient.tsx, Docs/env-vars.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; manual smoke via local dev+curl verified `/` landing 200, `/landing` -> `/` (308), and root deeplink redirect to `/app` (307).
2026-02-17 — P2 auth hardening: signed auth cookies + fail-closed required-auth config + identity-header opt-in gate. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 item 1 (auth), item 2 (ownership boundary hardening follow-up).
- Task: harden public-beta auth path so user identity is tamper-resistant and header spoofing is denied by default.
- Decisions: auth cookie now signed with `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` (`v1.<payload>.<hmac>`); `resolveRequestAuth` rejects unsigned cookies when `AUTH_REQUIRED` is true; identity headers only used when `AUTH_TRUST_IDENTITY_HEADERS` is truthy; worker now returns `503` for protected routes if no trusted identity source is configured; optional migration path via `AUTH_ALLOW_LEGACY_COOKIE`.
- Files: src/app/shared/auth.server.ts, src/worker.tsx, src/app/pages/sign-in/SignInPage.tsx, src/app/shared/auth.server.test.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json, types/env.d.ts, Docs/env-vars.md, .dev.vars.example, Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; review pass found one high issue (auth-required misconfig bypass) and resolved before final validation.
2026-02-17 — Added ship-progress tracker table to launch plan. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md execution tracking.
- Task: add at-a-glance progress table so remaining go-live work is obvious.
- Decisions: inserted table after Success Criteria; grouped by workstream with explicit Remaining Before Public Beta column; added completion snapshot to call out blockers fast.
- Files: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: current blockers now explicit in plan: pending QA verification pass + 72h internal soak gate.
2026-02-17 — Scout auth hardening plan (public beta). Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Phase2 auth gate.
- Task: catalog auth flow gaps and proto plan for signed-cookie/headers slice.
- Decisions: enforce signed-cookie baseline while tagging optional trusted-header secret; surface env doc/types updates for rollout clarity.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: retention plan only; implementation next sprint.
2026-02-17 — QA go/no-go pass executed; launch blocked on runtime route availability. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md QA row.
- Task: run high-risk launch checks and classify ship readiness.
- Decisions: recorded hard evidence in Docs/testing-report.md; moved QA tracker to `In progress (blocked)` pending route/funnel investigation. This checkpoint was superseded by later same-day rerun.
- Files: Docs/testing-report.md, Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: interim state only; later 2026-02-17 rerun confirmed sign-in POST `303` + auth cookie and restored QA green.
2026-02-17 — Route normalization hypothesis test (no code change retained). Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md QA routing checks.
- Task: A/B check `/app`, `/sign-in`, `/landing`, `/events` route behavior with and without trailing slash literals in `src/worker.tsx`.
- Decisions: reverted trailing-slash literals after proving behavior is identical; blocker was stale QA evidence, not route-table mismatch.
- Files: src/worker.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: route matrix still passed (`/` 200, `/app` 200, `/sign-in` 200, `/landing` 308, `/events?streamId=qa` 200, deep-link redirect 307) after reverting.
2026-02-17 — QA-doc sync now marks blockers resolved. PRD: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan QA gating.
- Task: update launch plan tracker row + testing report 2026-02-17 bullets with today’s verified route/auth evidence so docs reflect the actual auth funnel status.
- Decisions: declare QA go/no-go net green and call out rollout soak as next gate; rely on curl+auth behavior proof to retire earlier 404/401 blockers.
- Files: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, Docs/testing-report.md.
- Notes: blocker = rollout soak gate; next verification = high-risk manual checks once soak passes.
2026-02-17 — Balls closeout: auth-required funnel re-verified and log cleanup. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md QA + Rollout gates.
- Task: rerun auth-required route funnel with temporary env overrides, confirm deep-link/stream endpoints, and clean progress artifacts before commit.
- Decisions: verified unauth `/app` stays `401`, spoof headers denied, `/sign-in` POST returns `303` + auth cookie, authed `/app` returns `200`; restored `.dev.vars` and kept `src/worker.tsx` at canonical routes.
- Files: progress.txt.
- Notes: remaining ship gate is still rollout soak/high-risk manual checks; validation + review executed before commit.
2026-02-17 — Review finding cleanup for launch tracker consistency. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md Progress Tracker.
- Task: resolve /review findings on stale P3 “remaining” wording and conflicting blocked QA history text.
- Decisions: marked CTA/sign-in funnel rerun as already covered in QA pass; kept blocked checkpoint as history but labeled it superseded by same-day green rerun.
- Files: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md, progress.txt.
- Notes: docs/progress consistency fix only; no runtime code changes.
2026-02-17 — Branch header clarity + collapsed-sidebar anchor fix. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md P1 UX quality, P3 parity polish.
- Task: remove ambiguous top-bar branch icons and stop collapsed-sidebar controls from jumping into the second column when compare mode is open.
- Decisions: replaced repeated `GitBranch` affordances with distinct icons for compare/context/hide actions; moved sidebar-show + new-chat controls to a fixed left rail when sidebar is collapsed.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed (`pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`); recommend quick manual UI smoke on branch-open + sidebar-collapse path.
2026-02-17 — Pending assistant bubble no longer sticks after send completion. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md P1 interaction reliability.
- Task: fix active branch timeline showing “Connexus is preparing a response…” indefinitely after sends.
- Decisions: loader now keys on active stream/pending optimistic sends instead of `lastMessage.role === "user"`; stabilized message sort ties to keep user->assistant order when timestamps match.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed (`pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`); manual chat send smoke recommended to verify bubble lifecycle.
2026-02-17 — Landing page now includes real product screenshot section. Ref: Docs/public-beta-launch-plan.md P3 UX parity + landing conversion path.
- Task: add an on-page screenshot to home so visitors immediately see real branch split-view context.
- Decisions: captured a live in-app split-view screenshot and shipped a dedicated section (`Product in action`) between hero and demo; kept copy focused on parent/active branch value.
- Files: public/landing-branching-screenshot.png, src/app/components/landing/ProductScreenshotSection.tsx, src/app/components/landing/LandingShell.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed (`pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`); screenshot is static asset and can be replaced later without code changes.
2026-02-18 — Branch-create compare-open + source-context affordance pass. Ref: Docs/PRD.md Core Experience (Branch creation, Branch navigation, UX & A11y affordance clarity).
- Task: on create-branch, auto-open parent+child; emphasize child header source excerpt; pin source excerpt at composer top for first-prompt context.
- Decisions: branch-create navigation now sets `compare=1` so new child opens with parent pane visible; hide redundant active-branch header label when source context exists to free horizontal room; promote source excerpt to primary-styled chip and include parent branch title label; surface same excerpt in composer as compact `From parent selection` context line.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchableMessage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationComposer.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`; next manual smoke = create branch from selection and verify compare-open + header/composer context at desktop/mobile widths.
2026-02-18 — Composer branch-context auto-hide after first child send. Ref: Docs/PRD.md Core Experience UX affordance follow-up.
- Task: hide pinned `From parent selection` composer context after first successful message on child branch.
- Decisions: use persisted branch message presence (`role=user`) rather than optimistic state so context remains on send failures and disappears only after real persist.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/BranchColumn.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`.
2026-02-18 — Theme toggle relocated to sidebar only. Ref: Docs/PRD.md UX clarity / control discoverability.
- Task: keep theme button always in conversation sidebar; remove from branch header control row.
- Decisions: removed `ThemeToggle` from active branch leading actions in layout; inserted compact toggle in sidebar header control group next to sidebar/new-chat actions for consistent placement.
- Files: src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationSidebar.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`.
2026-02-18 — Sidebar child-branch click now always opens compare mode. Ref: Docs/PRD.md Core Experience branch navigation + branch creation context affordance.
- Task: clicking child branch in sidebar should always show parent branch beside child and jump to origin highlight context.
- Decisions: sidebar child branch href now adds `compare=1`; page forwards compare intent to layout; layout force-opens parent pane on child branch navigation when compare mode requested (same-conversation switches included).
- Files: src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationSidebar.tsx, src/app/pages/conversation/ConversationPage.tsx, src/app/components/conversation/ConversationLayout.tsx, progress.txt.
- Notes: validation passed `pnpm types`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`.
