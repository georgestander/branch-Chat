# Testing Report

## 2025-02-14

- `pnpm types`
  - ✅ Passes.
- Manual chat send (OpenAI streaming)
  - ✅ Verified with local `OPENAI_API_KEY`: assistant response streams into the UI and the timeline updates once completion finishes.
- Branch UI smoke test (manual)
  - ✅ Sidebar renders root branch and active column; branch creation CTA appears on assistant messages. Nested branch rendering pending full end-to-end test once branch duplication lands.
